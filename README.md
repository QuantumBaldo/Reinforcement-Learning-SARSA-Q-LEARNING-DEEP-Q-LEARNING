In Stochastic_frozen_lake_ClassicalReinforcementLearning.ipynb is shown an implementation of classical algorithms in a stochastic Frozen Lake environment (Environment shown in the book Artificial Intelligence: a Modern Approach of Russel, chapter 17)

in StochFrozenLake_QUANTUM.ipynb an attempt to approximate Q-values with Variational Quantum circuit is shown.
